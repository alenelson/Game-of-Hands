			Limit ONE challenge per day per
			person. Challenge must be made IRL.
			Contest not valid within 500 FEET of
			Miami Beach, any Walmart, or Barton
			F. Graf NYC. Challenge must be

			number of correct answers a USER
			gains before answering incorrectly.
			Each USER plays once per round. The
			series winner is determined when one
			USER wins two rounds. RUSS reserves
			the right to choose the PRIZE should
			he lose. PRIZE may not exceed 10
			U.S. DOLLARS. PRIZE may not be sold,
			transferred, and is not convertible
